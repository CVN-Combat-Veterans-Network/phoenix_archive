# COMBINED CEREMONIES

**Phoenix Archive Ritual Sequences**  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Purpose:** Multi-operator ceremonies for complex transformation

## OVERVIEW

Combined Ceremonies integrate **multiple operators** in sequence to achieve complex transformation goals. These ceremonies demonstrate:
- How operators build upon each other
