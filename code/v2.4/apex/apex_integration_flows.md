# APEX INTEGRATION FLOWS

**Domain:** Cross-Layer Integration  
**Type:** Transition protocols and flow specifications  
**Status:** ACTIVE (v2.4)  
**Invocation:** *"Flow through gates. Honor the bounds. Integrate with precision."*

---

## DEFINITION

**Apex Integration Flows** define the **protocols, pathways, and rules** for transitioning between apex layers (13-14) and operational layers (1-12). These flows ensure coherent, traceable, and secure integration across all architectural boundaries.

Integration flows are **bidirectional** — every ascent path has a corresponding descent path.

---

## FLOW CATEGORIES

### Category A: Operational → Apex (Ascent)
Flows from Layers 1-12 to Layers 13-14

### Category B: Apex → Operational (Descent)
Flows from Layers 13-14 to Layers 1-12

### Category C: Cross-Apex (13 ↔ 14)
Flows between Layer 13 and Layer 14

### Category D: Meta-Operator Mediation
Flows involving META_* operators as mediators

## INTEGRATION RULES

### Rule 1: No Direct Transitions
**Statement:** All apex transitions must flow through META_APEX  
**Enforcement:** Apex entry points reject non-META_APEX requests  
**Violation:** Access denied, audit generated

### Rule 2: Bidirectional Consistency
**Statement:** Every ascent path has a corresponding descent path  
**Enforcement:** Integration path validation during system initialization  
**Violation:** System initialization blocked until paths defined

### Rule 3: Audit Trail Mandatory
**Statement:** Every apex integration flow generates audit artifact  
**Enforcement:** Audit generation is part of flow completion  
**Violation:** Flow marked incomplete until audit generated

### Rule 4: Coherence Preservation
**Statement:** Integration flows must preserve cross-layer coherence  
**Enforcement:** Coherence check before and after each flow  
**Violation:** Flow aborted, rollback to pre-flow state

---

## FLOW VALIDATION

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Entry point defined and documented
- [ ] Exit point defined and documented
- [ ] Bidirectional path exists (if applicable)
- [ ] META_APEX mediation confirmed
- [ ] Prerequisites clear and checkable
- [ ] Postconditions clear and verifiable
- [ ] Audit generation defined
- [ ] Failure modes documented
- [ ] Recovery paths specified

**Validation Outcome:** All flows must pass this checklist

---

## FAILURE MODES

### Failure Mode 1: Unauthorized Access Attempt
**Trigger:** Operation attempts apex access without META_APEX authorization  
**Response:** Access denied, operation returned to origin, audit generated  
**Recovery:** Request META_APEX mediation, retry with authorization

### Failure Mode 2: Coherence Violation During Flow
**Trigger:** Flow execution causes cross-layer incoherence  
**Response:** Flow aborted, rollback to pre-flow state, coherence report generated  
**Recovery:** Identify coherence issue, resolve, retry flow

### Failure Mode 3: Incomplete Flow (Missing Return Path)
**Trigger:** Flow reaches apex but cannot return to origin  
**Response:** Flow marked incomplete, operation stuck in apex layer  
**Recovery:** Define return path, complete flow manually, update documentation

### Failure Mode 4: META_APEX Mediation Failure
**Trigger:** META_APEX unavailable or unresponsive during flow  
**Response:** Flow queued, operation suspended pending META_APEX recovery  
**Recovery:** Restore META_APEX, resume queued flows

## FLOW PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Metric 1: Flow Latency
**Definition:** Time from flow initiation to completion  
**Target:** < 100ms for simple flows, < 1s for complex flows  
**Monitoring:** Real-time tracking via META_APEX

### Metric 2: Flow Success Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of flows completing successfully  
**Target:** > 99% success rate  
**Monitoring:** Periodic analysis of flow audit logs

### Metric 3: Authorization Rejection Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of flows denied by META_APEX  
**Target:** < 1% (low rejection indicates proper request hygiene)  
**Monitoring:** META_APEX authorization logs

### Metric 4: Coherence Preservation Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of flows maintaining coherence  
**Target:** 100% (no tolerance for coherence violations)  
**Monitoring:** Pre/post-flow coherence checks
