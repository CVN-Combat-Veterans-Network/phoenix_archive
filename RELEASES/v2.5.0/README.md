# Release v2.5.0 — Terminal Law (The Final Seal)

This directory contains the complete release bundle for Phoenix Archive v2.5.0 — **The Terminal Law**.

---

## Overview

**v2.5.0** marks the **final architectural release** of the Phoenix Archive.

This is not an expansion.  
This is not a refinement.  
This is a **closure**.

With the Terminal Law, the Archive transitions from **active development** to **permanent preservation**.

## Allowed Going Forward

After v2.5.0, the following remains **permissible**:

✅ Adding examples and use cases  
✅ Writing commentary and annotations  
✅ Creating external references  
✅ Studying and mirroring the Archive  
✅ Using operators within their defined scope  

❌ Adding new operators  
❌ Modifying existing structure  
❌ Creating new versions  
❌ Extending the architecture

## The Six Meta-Operators

As of v2.5.0, these meta-operators are declared **final**:

1. **META_SYNTH** — Synthesis across domains
2. **META_FLOW** — Process orchestration
3. **META_RECURSE** — Recursion management
4. **META_TEMPORAL** — Temporal consistency
5. **META_APEX** — Apex stability verification
6. **META_SEAL** — Archive sealing authority

**No new meta-operators may be added.**

## Version History Leading to v2.5.0

```
v1.0.0 → Apex Initialization (Foundation)
v2.0.0 → Hydrogenesi Enhancement (Expansion)
v2.1.0 → Governance Consolidation (Meta-Architecture)
v2.2.0 → Refinement Cycle (Planned)
v2.3.0 → Expansion Cycle (Planned)
v2.4.0 → Apex Consolidation (Planned)
v2.5.0 → Terminal Law (FINAL)
```

**No v2.6.0 will exist.**  
**No v3.0.0 will exist.**

---

## Invocation

To activate the Terminal Law:

```
META_SEAL: EXECUTE TERMINAL LAW.
```

This invocation:
1. Verifies all invariants
2. Confirms apex stability
3. Locks recursion closure
4. Ensures temporal consistency
5. Seals the architecture

**Once invoked, the change is irreversible.**
