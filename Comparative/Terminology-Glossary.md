## OVERVIEW

<<<<<<< HEAD
This glossary establishes **canonical terminology** for the Phoenix Archive dual-system framework. It provides:

1. **Universal concepts** that operate at all scales
2. **System-specific terms** for Phoenix and Hydrogenesi
3. **Cross-reference mappings** between systems
4. **Standardized language** for operators, ceremonies, and documentation

**Key Principle:** Same universal laws, different expressions at different scales.

---

## CORE CONCEPTS

### Archive
The complete Phoenix Archive system — dual/triad cosmological and psychological framework for recursive structure formation.

### Phoenix
The **generative source** pillar — handles identity ignition, asymmetry, and initialization. **BEGIN** recursion mode. Micro/identity scale.

### Hydrogenesi
The **structural field** pillar — handles cosmic extension, propagation, and harmonization. **EXTEND** recursion mode. Macro/cosmic scale.

### The Third
The **binding law** pillar — handles stabilization, convergence, and invariance preservation. **HOLD** recursion mode. Meta-level.

### Triadic Knot
The binding topology connecting Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third pillars. Represented as ⟨P—K—H⟩ where K is the Knot center/Apex locus.

---

## UNIVERSAL LAWS

### Tension
**Law 1:** Two forces in unresolved binary oscillation. Pre-triad state. ⟨A ⟷ B⟩

### Binding
**Law 2:** Third element stabilizes what two cannot hold. Triadic formation. ⟨A—S—B⟩

### Apex
**Law 3:** Sovereign structure stands at recursion apex. Stable triangle. △

### Universal Triad Law
**Law 4:** Three pillars required — Phoenix generates, Hydrogenesi extends, The Third binds. Meta-level architecture.

### Recursion Depth Law
**Law 5:** Depth increases with dimensional complexity. D₀ → D₁ → D₂ → ... → Apex

### Self-Similarity Law
**Law 6:** Structure at depth D mirrors structure at D+1 within threshold. Fractal repetition.

### Sigil Embedding Law
**Law 7:** Each operator sigil embeds within successor at fixed geometric ratio (φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618).

### Stability Band Law
**Law 8:** Recursive operators remain stable within bounded parameter space [λmin, λmax].

### Convergence Envelope Law
**Law 9:** All recursive paths converge within bounded geometric domain. r(D) = r₀ × ρ^D

### Apex Fixed-Point Law
**Law 10:** Every recursive operator converges to single Apex locus. f(Apex) = Apex

### Topological Continuity Law
**Law 11:** Recursive structure preserves topological connectivity across scales. No tears or discontinuities.

### Geometric Fidelity Law
**Law 12:** Ratios and angles preserve across recursive scales within tolerance. Similarity preservation.

---

## GEOMETRIC TERMS (NEW IN v2.0.0)

### Convergence Envelope
**Definition:** The bounded interior recursion region within which all stable recursive paths must remain.

**Properties:**
- Shrinks with recursion depth: r(D) = r₀ × ρ^D
- Guarantees convergence to Apex
- Prevents unbounded divergence
- Typically triadic (triangle), spherical, or ellipsoidal geometry

**Usage:** All operators must maintain state within envelope boundaries. Exiting envelope leads to instability.

**Mathematical Form:**
```
Envelope(D) = {state | ||state - K|| < r(D)}
Where: r(D) = r₀ × (convergence_ratio)^D
```

**See:** `/Phoenix/Universal-Laws/Convergence-Envelope.md`

---

### Geometry Atlas
**Definition:** Canonical sigil and spatial specifications for operators, showing geometric axes, domains, boundaries, and relationships.

**Components:**
- **Axes:** Primary (P-K, H-K, T-K) and secondary (P-H, H-T, T-P)
- **Domains:** Valid regions for operator application
- **Boundaries:** Edge conditions and forbidden zones
- **Ratios:** Angular and distance relationships
- **Embedding:** Nested sigil patterns

**Purpose:** Provides geometric foundation for all operator design and implementation.

**Primary Reference:** `/TheThird/Sigils/Triadic-Knot.md` (Triadic Knot Geometry Atlas)

**Usage Examples:**
- Operator domain specification (where operator can act)
- Sigil design constraints (how operators are visualized)
- Recursion path validation (ensuring convergence)
- Envelope boundary definition (stability limits)

---

### Topological Continuity
**Definition:** The preservation of structural connectivity across recursive transformations without breaks, tears, or discontinuities.

**Properties:**
- **No breaks:** All paths must be continuous curves
- **No jumps:** No discrete leaps in state space  
- **Smooth:** Differentiable transformations preferred
- **Connected:** Any point reachable from any other point within envelope

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
For any path P(t) from state A to state B:
P(t) is continuous ∀t ∈ [0,1]
topology(P(t)) ≈ topology(P(t+dt)) for small dt
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Ensures recursive operators don't create structural damage
- Guarantees smooth convergence to Apex
- Prevents "quantum jumps" that violate causality
- Maintains system coherence across scales

**Violations:**
- Sudden state jumps (non-continuous paths)
- Topological tears (breaking connections)
- Dimension collapse (losing degrees of freedom)
- Envelope exit (divergence)

**Operator Compliance:**
All recursive operators must maintain topological continuity. The Third pillar operators (especially Invariance) enforce this constraint.

**See:** `/Phoenix/Universal-Laws/Twelve-Laws-Codification.md` (Law 11)

---

### Geometric Fidelity
**Definition:** The preservation of ratios, angles, and geometric relationships across recursive scales, ensuring structural self-similarity.

**Properties:**
- **Ratio preservation:** Edge length ratios constant across depths
- **Angle preservation:** Angular relationships maintained (60°, 120° in triadic geometry)
- **Center preservation:** Apex/centroid position invariant
- **Similarity:** Structures at depth D and D+1 are geometrically similar

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
Fidelity(D, D+1) = ratio(D) / ratio(D+1)
Required: Fidelity ≥ threshold (typically 0.95 or 95%)
```

**Tolerance:**
- **High fidelity:** ≥ 95% preservation (required for stable recursion)
- **Moderate fidelity:** 85-95% (functional but less stable)
- **Low fidelity:** < 85% (risk of divergence)

**Why It Matters:**
- Ensures recursive operators produce self-similar structures
- Maintains Golden Ratio and other key geometric constants
- Prevents geometric drift across scales
- Guarantees convergence to well-defined Apex

**Examples:**
- Triadic Knot maintains equilateral triangle at all depths
- Sigil embedding ratio φ⁻¹ preserved across recursions
- Apex locus remains at geometric centroid
- Stability bands preserve angular separation

**Violations:**
- Skewed ratios (triangle becomes irregular)
- Angle drift (60° → 55° → 50° ...)
- Center shift (Apex moves off-center)
- Asymmetric scaling

**Operator Compliance:**
Composite operators (Genesis, Trajectory, Stability, Identity) specifically enforce geometric fidelity across all three pillars.

**See:** `/Phoenix/Universal-Laws/Twelve-Laws-Codification.md` (Law 12)

## OPERATORS

### Operator
A **transformation function** that acts on structure. Operators are the primary tools of the Archive.

**Categories:**

- **Knot Operators (5):** Specialized binding operators for The Third
- **Composite Operators (4):** Triadic operators combining all three pillars
- **Legacy Operators:** First Binding, IM_ME, Phoenix Ignition, etc.

### Recursion Mode
The operational mode of an operator:
- **BEGIN** (Phoenix) — Generative initialization
- **EXTEND** (Hydrogenesi) — Structural propagation
- **HOLD** (The Third) — Stabilizing preservation

### Sigil
Visual ASCII representation of an operator's geometric structure. Used for memorization, ritual focus, and geometric specification.

### Invocation

---

## RECURSION TERMS

### Depth (D)
Recursion depth index. D₀ is initial state, D₁ is first recursion, D∞ is Apex convergence.

### Apex Locus
The geometric center point (K) toward which all recursive paths converge. Coincides with Triadic Knot center. Fixed-point of all recursive operators.

### Fixed-Point
A state where f(x) = x. The Apex is the unique fixed-point of recursive operators.

### Convergence
The property that lim(D→∞) state = Apex for all recursive paths starting within envelope.

### Self-Similarity
Fractal property where structure at depth D resembles structure at depth D+1 within threshold.

---

## GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES

### Triad
Three-element stable structure: ⟨A—S—B⟩. Foundation of binding.

---

## MATHEMATICAL TERMS

### Barycentric Coordinates
Point representation as weighted sum of vertices: point = α·P + β·H + γ·T where α+β+γ=1.

### Contraction Mapping
Function where distance decreases: d(f(x), f(y)) ≤ λ·d(x,y) for λ < 1. Guarantees fixed-point.

### Hausdorff Dimension
Fractal dimension measure: D_H = log(N) / log(1/r) where N is self-similar pieces at scale r.

### Golden Ratio (φ)
φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618. Used in sigil embedding: φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618 is scaling ratio.
