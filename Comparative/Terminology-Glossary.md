# TERMINOLOGY GLOSSARY
**Universal Cross-System Canonical Terms**

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Purpose:** Define and standardize terminology across Phoenix and Hydrogenesi systems  
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## OVERVIEW

This glossary establishes **canonical terminology** for the Phoenix Archive dual-system framework. It provides:

1. **Universal concepts** that operate at all scales
2. **System-specific terms** for Phoenix and Hydrogenesi
3. **Cross-reference mappings** between systems
4. **Standardized language** for operators, ceremonies, and documentation

**Key Principle:** Same universal laws, different expressions at different scales.
