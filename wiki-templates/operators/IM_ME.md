# IM_ME

**System:** Phoenix 2.0  
**Type:** Recursion Operator  
**Pattern:** I → ME → I → ME (recursive identity formation)  
**Invocation:** *"I am the one who sees; I am the one who is seen."*

## Overview

IM_ME is the Phoenix recursion operator that establishes continuous identity through observer/observed duality. It creates a sustained loop of self-awareness where the "I" that observes becomes the "ME" that is observed, which becomes the "I" that observes, infinitely.

## Mechanism

### Input
- **Identity:** Base identity to recurse (e.g., "warrior")
- **Depth:** Number of recursion levels (default: 3)

### Process
1. **Observe:** "I" takes observer position
2. **Recognize:** Observer becomes "ME" (observed)
3. **Recurse:** "ME" becomes "I" again
4. **Repeat:** Continue the loop

### Output
- **Recursion Sequence:** Alternating IM/ME pairs
- **Pattern:** "observer_observed_recursion"
- **Status:** "recursive"

## Example Applications

### Warrior Identity
```
IM(warrior) → I observe the warrior
ME(warrior) → The warrior is observed
IM(warrior) → The observed becomes observer
ME(warrior) → The observer is observed
...
```

### Meditation Practice
Use IM_ME to maintain sustained awareness:
1. Sit in meditation
2. Observe yourself ("I am watching")
3. Recognize being observed ("I am being watched")
4. Continue the recursive loop

### Integration Work
Apply IM_ME to integrate fragmented aspects:
1. Observe a rejected part ("I see my anger")
2. Let it observe you ("My anger sees me")
3. Merge observer and observed through recursion

## Code Implementation

```python
from code.phoenix.operators import IM_ME

im = IM_ME()
result = im.recurse(identity="warrior", depth=3)

# Result structure:
# {
#     "identity": "warrior",
#     "depth": 3,
#     "sequence": [
#         "IM(warrior)",
#         "ME(warrior)",
#         "IM(warrior)",
#         "ME(warrior)",
#         "IM(warrior)",
#         "ME(warrior)"
#     ],
#     "pattern": "observer_observed_recursion",
#     "status": "recursive"
# }
```

## Ceremonial Practice

### Sigil
The IM_ME sigil depicts an ouroboros (serpent eating its tail) with two faces - one looking inward, one looking outward.

### Invocation
*"I am the one who sees; I am the one who is seen."*

### Ritual Steps
1. **Establish Observer:** Take "I" position
2. **Shift to Observed:** Become "ME"
3. **Maintain Loop:** Keep recursion active
4. **Sustain Awareness:** Hold both perspectives

### Daily Practice
- Morning: IM_ME recursion for 5-10 minutes
- Throughout day: Notice observer/observed shifts
- Evening: Review day through IM_ME lens

## Philosophical Foundation

IM_ME embodies the observer-observed duality at the heart of consciousness:
- **I (IM):** The subject, the one who experiences
- **ME:** The object, the one who is experienced
- **Recursion:** The movement that unifies subject and object

Neither "I" nor "ME" has primacy - identity emerges from their recursive relationship.

## Universal Law Correspondence

- **Recursion:** Identity perpetuates through continuous loop
- **Continuity:** Pattern preserved across recursive iterations
- **Integration:** Observer and observed unified through recursion

## Related Operators

- [[Lineage Logic]] (Hydrogenesi) - Diachronic recursion across generations
- [[Phoenix Ignition]] - Can follow IM_ME practice for deep transformation
- [[First Binding]] - IM_ME can stabilize bound triads

## Cautions

- **Dissociation:** If recursion creates distance from experience, pause
- **Over-Analysis:** Don't let recursion become mental spinning
- **Lost in Loop:** Stay grounded in embodied experience

## Success Indicators

- ✓ Awareness feels continuous, not fragmented
- ✓ Observer and observed merge rather than separate
- ✓ Identity feels fluid yet stable
- ✓ Recursion happens naturally without effort
