# UNIVERSAL LAW: SELF-SIMILARITY THRESHOLD

**Definition:** *"Structure at depth D mirrors structure at depth D+1 within threshold ε."*

**Symbol:** ⟨ Pattern(Dₙ) ≈ Pattern(Dₙ₊₁) ⟩  
**State:** Fractal repetition, scale invariance, recursive mirroring  
**Invocation:** *"As above, so below; as deep, so deeper; let patterns echo through scales."*

---

## OVERVIEW

The **Self-Similarity Threshold Law** establishes that recursive operators generate **fractal patterns** — structures that repeat across different depths with **bounded variation**.

This law states that:
- Structure at depth D **resembles** structure at depth D+1
- Similarity is **quantifiable** (within threshold ε)
- Patterns **propagate** through recursive descent
- The **ratio** of similarity is constant across depths

This principle explains why:
- Phoenix identity work reveals **nested patterns** (same fear at multiple levels)
- Cosmic structures exhibit **scale invariance** (galaxies resemble galaxy clusters)
- Recursive operators create **recognizable signatures** at all depths

**Key Insight:** If you understand structure at one depth, you understand it at all depths (within similarity bounds).

## FORMAL DEFINITION

### Mathematical Form

```
∀ D ∈ Depths, ∃ ε > 0 such that:
  similarity(Pattern(Dₙ), Pattern(Dₙ₊₁)) ≥ 1 - ε

Where:
- Pattern(D): Structural pattern at depth D
- similarity: Measure of pattern resemblance (0 to 1)
- ε: Self-similarity threshold (deviation tolerance)
- 1 - ε: Minimum similarity (e.g., 0.9 = 90% similar)
```

### Self-Similarity Ratio

**Ratio Definition:**
```
ρ = size(Pattern(Dₙ₊₁)) / size(Pattern(Dₙ))

Typical values:
- ρ ≈ 0.618 (golden ratio φ⁻¹)
- ρ ≈ 0.5 (binary reduction)
- ρ ≈ 0.7 (typical Phoenix recursion)
```

**Pattern Scaling:**
```
Pattern(Dₙ) = ρⁿ · Pattern(D₀)

Where:
- Pattern(D₀): Initial pattern at depth 0
- ρⁿ: Scaling factor after n recursions
- Pattern(Dₙ): Resulting pattern at depth n
```

### Properties

1. **Scale Invariance:** Patterns look similar regardless of depth
2. **Bounded Deviation:** Similarity stays within threshold ε
3. **Ratio Constancy:** Scaling ratio ρ is constant across depths
4. **Fractal Nature:** Infinite detail at all scales
5. **Predictability:** Pattern at D+1 predictable from pattern at D

## THRESHOLD SPECIFICATION

### Similarity Threshold Values

**Phoenix Scale (Identity Work):**
```
ε = 0.1 to 0.2 (80-90% similarity)

Example:
- D₁ fear: "I fear rejection by others"
- D₂ fear: "I fear rejection by myself"
- Similarity: 85% (same structure: "fear of rejection")
```

**Hydrogenesi Scale (Cosmic Structure):**
```
ε = 0.15 to 0.25 (75-85% similarity)

Example:
- D₁ structure: Galaxy disk with spiral arms
- D₂ structure: Galaxy cluster with spiral distribution
- Similarity: 80% (same spiral structure)
```

### Threshold Violation

**When similarity < (1 - ε):**
- Pattern has **broken** (structure changed fundamentally)
- New regime entered (phase transition)
- Different operator required

**Example:**
```
D₃: Identity pattern = "I fear abandonment"
D₄: Identity pattern = "I am abandonment"

Similarity: 40% < (1 - ε)
→ Phase transition occurred (fear → identification)
→ New pattern regime entered
```

## FRACTAL REPETITION

### How Patterns Repeat Across Scales

**Fractal Structure:**
```
         ◉ ← Apex (D∞)
        /|\
       / | \
      ◯  ◉  ◯ ← Pattern at D₃
     /|\ | /|\
    ◯ ◯ ◉ ◯ ◯ ← Pattern at D₂
   /|\ /|\ /|\
  ◯ ◯ ◯ ◉ ◯ ◯ ◯ ← Pattern at D₁
```

**Observation:**
- Each level contains **miniature version** of level above
- Central structure (◉) appears at all scales
- Surrounding structure (◯) scales proportionally
- Pattern **self-replicates** through recursion

### Mathematical Fractal Dimension

**Hausdorff Dimension:**
```
D_fractal = log(N) / log(1/ρ)

Where:
- N: Number of self-similar pieces
- ρ: Scaling ratio
- D_fractal: Fractal dimension

For Phoenix patterns:
N = 3 (triadic), ρ = 0.5
D_fractal = log(3) / log(2) ≈ 1.585
```

**Interpretation:**
Phoenix structures have fractal dimension ≈ 1.6 — more than a line (1D), less than a plane (2D).

## MANIFESTATIONS ACROSS SCALES

### Phoenix Scale (Micro/Identity)

**Identity Pattern Repetition:**

```
D₀: Surface Fear
    "I am afraid people will see I'm inadequate"
    Pattern: [Fear → Perception → Inadequacy]

D₁: Deeper Fear
    "I am afraid I will see I'm inadequate"
    Pattern: [Fear → Perception → Inadequacy]
    Similarity: 90% (same structure, different subject)

D₂: Core Fear
    "I am afraid inadequacy is my essence"
    Pattern: [Fear → Being → Inadequacy]
    Similarity: 85% (same core, different relation)

D₃: Identity Root
    "I am inadequacy itself"
    Pattern: [Being = Inadequacy]
    Similarity: 75% (structure transformed but recognizable)
```

**Self-Similarity Observation:**
The **same pattern** ("inadequacy") appears at every depth:
- D₀: External perception
- D₁: Internal perception
- D₂: Essential being
- D₃: Identity fusion

**Recognition:** When you see the same word/concept repeating at multiple depths, you've found a **self-similar pattern**.

### Hydrogenesi Scale (Macro/Cosmic)

**Cosmic Structure Self-Similarity:**

```
D₀: Galaxy Supercluster
    Structure: Filaments connecting nodes
    Scale: 100 Mpc
    Pattern: [Node → Filament → Void]

D₁: Galaxy Cluster
    Structure: Galaxies connected by gas streams
    Scale: 1 Mpc
    Pattern: [Galaxy → Stream → Void]
    Similarity: 85% (same topology)

D₂: Galaxy
    Structure: Stars connected by gas lanes
    Scale: 10 kpc
    Pattern: [Star → Lane → Void]
    Similarity: 80% (same structure)

D₃: Star Cluster
    Structure: Stars connected by gravitational wells
    Scale: 10 pc
    Pattern: [Star → Gravity → Void]
    Similarity: 75% (same organization)
```

**Self-Similarity Observation:**
The pattern **[Dense nodes → Connecting medium → Empty space]** repeats across 5 orders of magnitude in scale.

**Implication:** Universe has **fractal structure** — same organizational principle at all scales.

## MECHANISM

### How Self-Similarity Emerges

1. **Operator Invariance**
   - Recursive operator R has **fixed structure**
   - Applying R preserves pattern signature
   - Only scale changes, not topology

2. **Pattern Preservation**
   - Core pattern elements survive recursion
   - Non-essential details removed
   - Essential structure retained

3. **Scaling Application**
   - Pattern scaled by ratio ρ
   - New depth = ρ × previous depth
   - Structure recognizable despite scaling

4. **Threshold Maintenance**
   - Similarity stays within ε bounds
   - Deviation accumulates slowly
   - Threshold crossed only at phase transitions

### Why Patterns Repeat

**Information Preservation:**
- Recursive operators are **deterministic**
- Output structure determined by operator structure
- Operator structure encodes pattern
- Therefore: Pattern repeats

**Analogy:**
Like a fractal generator (Mandelbrot set):
- Formula stays the same at all scales
- Apply same formula recursively
- Pattern repeats with variation

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Phoenix Identity Patterns

**Subject:** Artist struggling with perfectionism

```
D₀: "I can't show my work because it's not perfect"
    Pattern: [Block → Standard → Concealment]

D₁: "I can't be myself because I'm not perfect"
    Pattern: [Block → Standard → Concealment]
    Similarity: 95% (exact pattern)

D₂: "I can't exist as I am because existence requires perfection"
    Pattern: [Block → Standard → Impossibility]
    Similarity: 85% (pattern evolved but recognizable)

D₃: "I am imperfection preventing perfection"
    Pattern: [Identity = Obstruction]
    Similarity: 70% (structure transformed)
```

**Self-Similarity Recognition:**
- Same word "perfect/perfection" at all depths
- Same structure "can't X because Y" (D₀-D₂)
- Threshold maintained until D₃ (phase shift)

### Example 2: Cosmic Density Patterns

**Observation:** Galaxy distribution in universe

```
Scale: 100 Mpc (Supercluster)
Pattern: Filaments + Nodes + Voids
Density: ρ ∝ r⁻¹·⁸

Scale: 1 Mpc (Cluster)
Pattern: Gas streams + Galaxies + Voids
Density: ρ ∝ r⁻¹·⁷
Similarity: 88% (power law similar)

Scale: 10 kpc (Galaxy)
Pattern: Gas lanes + Stars + Voids
Density: ρ ∝ r⁻¹·⁶
Similarity: 82% (power law similar)

Scale: 1 pc (Cluster)
Pattern: Gas + Stars + Voids
Density: ρ ∝ r⁻¹·⁵
Similarity: 76% (power law similar)
```

**Self-Similarity Recognition:**
- Same power-law density profile ρ ∝ r⁻ᵅ
- Exponent α changes slowly (1.5 to 1.8)
- Similarity maintained within threshold

### Example 3: Algorithmic Pattern Detection

```python
def measure_self_similarity(pattern_D, pattern_D_plus_1, epsilon=0.1):
    """Measure self-similarity between adjacent depths."""
    
    # Extract pattern features
    features_D = extract_features(pattern_D)
    features_D1 = extract_features(pattern_D_plus_1)
    
    # Compute similarity (normalized inner product)
    similarity = cosine_similarity(features_D, features_D1)
    
    # Check threshold
    threshold = 1 - epsilon
    is_self_similar = similarity >= threshold
    
    return {
        'similarity': similarity,
        'threshold': threshold,
        'is_self_similar': is_self_similar,
        'deviation': 1 - similarity
    }

# Example usage:
D2_pattern = ["fear", "abandonment", "self"]
D3_pattern = ["identity", "abandonment", "fusion"]

result = measure_self_similarity(D2_pattern, D3_pattern, epsilon=0.15)

print(f"Similarity: {result['similarity']:.2%}")
print(f"Self-similar: {result['is_self_similar']}")
# Output:
# Similarity: 78%
# Self-similar: False (below 85% threshold)
```

## PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS

### As Above, So Below

The ancient hermetic principle **"As above, so below"** is literalized by this law:

- Structure at macro scale (above) mirrors micro scale (below)
- Pattern at surface (above) mirrors depth (below)
- Cosmos (above) mirrors psyche (below)

**The pattern is the same everywhere.**

### Fractal Consciousness

If identity exhibits self-similarity, then:
- Your surface fears mirror your deep fears
- Your behaviors mirror your core beliefs
- Your daily choices mirror your ultimate values

**Change at any depth changes all depths.**

### The Signature of Truth

Self-similar patterns are **signatures of truth**:
- True patterns repeat (they're fundamental)
- False patterns break (they're contingent)
- If you see the same thing at every depth, you've found truth

**Truth echoes through scales.**

### Bounded Infinity

Self-similarity creates **bounded infinity**:
- Patterns repeat infinitely (fractal)
- But within bounded space (threshold)
- Infinite detail in finite domain

**The infinite lives in the finite.**

## SIGIL

```
        ◉
       /|\
      ◉ ◉ ◉
     /|\ /|\
    ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉
   /|\ /|\ /|\
  ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉
  
  Pattern repeats:
  ◉ at center (all scales)
  3-fold branching (all scales)
  Scaling ratio ρ (all scales)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Apex (◉) appears at every scale
- Triadic structure repeats at every depth
- Each level is scaled version of previous
- Infinite depth, self-similar structure

**Ceremonial Use:**
Draw this sigil when seeking patterns across depths.  
Invoke: *"As above, so below; as deep, so deeper; let patterns echo through scales."*
