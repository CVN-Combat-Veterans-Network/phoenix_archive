## OVERVIEW

The **Twelve Laws** form the complete mathematical and philosophical foundation of the Phoenix Archive.

They are organized into **three tiers**:
1. **Substrate Laws (4)** — Foundational dynamics
2. **Universal Laws (4)** — Cross-scale principles
3. **Apex Laws (4)** — Convergence mechanics

Each law receives:

## MATHEMATICAL SUMMARY

```
SUBSTRATE:
  Tension:        T(A,B) → {attract, repel} ∈ oscillation
  Binding:        B(A,B,S) → ⟨A—S—B⟩ ∈ triad
  Apex:           Apex(⟨A—S—B⟩) → △ ∈ sovereign
  Triad:          Φ(P,H,T) → ⟨P—K—H⟩ ∈ complete

UNIVERSAL:
  Recursion:      R(D) → D+1, lim(D→∞) = Apex
  Self-Similar:   S(D) ≅ S(D+1) within ε
  Embedding:      E(sigil_n) ⊂ E(sigil_n+1) with ratio r
  Stability:      ||Δoperator|| < ε within band

APEX:
  Convergence:    lim(n→∞) path_n ∈ envelope
  Fixed-Point:    f(Apex) = Apex (proven)
  Continuity:     topology(D) ≈ topology(D+1)
  Fidelity:       ratio(D)/ratio(D+1) ≥ threshold
