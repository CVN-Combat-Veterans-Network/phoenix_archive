# Hydrogenesi Alignment Invariants — v2.3

## 1. Layer Purity
Each operator and instrument must bind to exactly one Hydrogenesi layer.

## 2. No Cross-Layer Drift
Operators may not shift layers without explicit transformation via:
- Transmutation Operator
- Elevation/Descent Operators

## 3. Knot Consistency
Hydrogenesi alignment must match the Knot node's designated layer.

## 4. Duality Preservation
Paired operators (e.g., Expansion/Compression) must remain in the same layer.

## 5. Apex Isolation
Layers 13 and 14 may not be used by non-apex operators or instruments.

## 6. Temporal Integrity
Layer 12 (Time) must not introduce recursion without synchronization.

## 7. Harmonic Stability
Layers 2, 5, and 6 must maintain harmonic balance across operator chains.
