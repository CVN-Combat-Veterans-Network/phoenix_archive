# Knot Structural Invariants — v2.3

## 1. One-to-One Binding
Each Knot node binds exactly:
- one primary operator
- one primary instrument

No node may be left unbound or multiply bound at the same tier.

## 2. Pillar Coherence
All nodes within a Triad pillar must:
- share a coherent functional theme
- maintain compatible Hydrogenesi layer alignments

## 3. Layer Consistency
For each mapping:
- Knot Node → Operator → Instrument → Hydrogenesi Layer
the Hydrogenesi layer must remain consistent across the chain.

## 4. Directional Integrity
Flow direction must be preserved:
- Triad Pillar → Knot Node → Operator → Instrument
Reverse bindings require explicit design and documentation.

## 5. Non-Recursive Knot
Knot mappings must not introduce uncontrolled recursion:
- no node may depend on itself via operator/instrument chains
- recursion must be mediated by explicit recursion operators

## 6. Apex Isolation
Apex nodes (G3, G4) must:
- only bind to apex‑class operators and instruments
- not be used for routine or low‑level flows

## 7. Observability
Every Knot mapping must be:
- observable via introspection operators
- traceable from Triad → Knot → Operator → Instrument → Hydrogenesi
