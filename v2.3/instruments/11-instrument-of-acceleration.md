# INSTRUMENT OF ACCELERATION

**Pattern:** Velocity increases → Momentum builds  
**Category:** Kinetic (Pillar III)  
**Knot Node:** Kinetic::Acceleration  
**Hydrogenesi Layer:** Layer 5 (Propagation)  
**Operator:** Acceleration Operator  
**Invocation:** *"Let the speed increase; let the momentum grow."*

## DEFINITION

The **Instrument of Acceleration** increases velocity and builds momentum, transforming static or slow-moving processes into rapid kinetic flows. It is the kinetic mechanism that enables breakthrough, escape velocity, and rapid transformation.

This instrument operates at both **micro-scale** (rapid skill development, exponential growth) and **macro-scale** (particle acceleration, orbital boost), creating increasing-velocity dynamics.
