# Apex Invariants — v2.4

The apex layers enforce the following invariants:

1. **Essence Isolation (Layer 13)**  
   Essence flows must not leak into non-apex layers without explicit descent.

2. **Apex Isolation (Layer 14)**  
   Only apex-class operators and meta-operators may operate at Layer 14.

3. **Safe Descent**  
   All apex outputs must define a valid descent path back into the Triad.

4. **No Implicit Apex Access**  
   Apex layers must never be invoked implicitly.

5. **Meta-Operator Mediation**  
   All cross-layer orchestration at apex levels must be mediated by meta-operators.
