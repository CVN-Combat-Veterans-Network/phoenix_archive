# Apex Integration — v2.4

This document describes how Layers 13 (Essence) and 14 (Apex) integrate with:

- v2.3 operators and instruments
- v2.4 meta-operators
- Triad and Knot structures

## Apex Roles

- **Layer 13 — Essence:** Extraction‑Prime, Infusion, essence-level flows.
- **Layer 14 — Apex:** Apex Binding, Apex Release, sealing and crown behavior.

## Integration Paths

- Triad → Knot → Operator → Instrument → Hydrogenesi (1–12) → META_APEX → Layers 13–14
- Layers 13–14 → META_APEX → META_FLOW → Triad (descent)

All apex transitions must pass through `META_APEX`.
