# Meta-Operator Integration — v2.4

This document defines how META_* operators coordinate apex behavior.

## Roles

- **META_SYNTH:** Synthesizes multi-operator chains.
- **META_FLOW:** Routes flows across pillars and layers.
- **META_RECURSE:** Enforces recursion envelopes.
- **META_TEMPORAL:** Orchestrates time (sync/desync).
- **META_APEX:** Controls apex transitions (Layers 13–14).
- **META_SEAL:** Prepares the system for Terminal Law sealing.

## Integration Rules

1. All apex transitions must be mediated by `META_APEX`.
2. All recursion at or touching apex layers must be mediated by `META_RECURSE`.
3. Temporal modulation at apex layers must be mediated by `META_TEMPORAL`.
4. System-wide synthesis that touches apex layers must involve `META_SYNTH`.
5. Sealing operations must be initiated by `META_SEAL`.
