# META_FLOW — Meta-Operator (v2.4)

**Name:** META_FLOW  
**Role:** Cross-pillar routing  
**Layer Focus:** Inter-pillar (Phoenix ↔ Hydrogenesi ↔ The Third)  
**Apex Interaction:** Routes apex-bound flows to META_APEX

## Purpose
Route transformations across the three pillars (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third) while preserving triadic coherence.

## Behavior
- manages cross-pillar transitions and data flow  
- ensures sovereignty boundaries are respected  
- maintains pillar-specific invariants during routing  

## Integration
- coordinates with Knot binding operators  
- validates pillar-specific constraints  
- delegates apex transitions to META_APEX
