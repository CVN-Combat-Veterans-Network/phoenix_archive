# META_SYNTH — Meta-Operator (v2.4)

**Name:** META_SYNTH  
**Role:** Multi-operator synthesis  
**Layer Focus:** Cross-layer  
**Apex Interaction:** Delegates apex transitions to META_APEX

## Purpose
Coordinate multiple operators into a unified synthesized transformation.

## Behavior
- orchestrates ordered operator chains  
- merges outputs into coherent aggregates  
- respects Knot and Hydrogenesi mappings  

## Integration
- binds to Knot as a meta-node  
- consults Hydrogenesi alignment for layer-safe routing  
- may invoke META_APEX for apex transitions
