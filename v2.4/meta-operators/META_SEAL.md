# META_SEAL — Meta-Operator (v2.4)

**Name:** META_SEAL  
**Role:** Preparation for Terminal Law sealing  
**Layer Focus:** All layers (pre-Terminal Law)  
**Apex Interaction:** Final apex state preparation

## Purpose
Prepare the Archive for Terminal Law activation by ensuring all structures are stable, all invariants are satisfied, and all apex states are sealed.

## Behavior
- validates structural integrity across all layers  
- verifies invariant satisfaction  
- seals apex states for Terminal Law transition  
- generates Terminal Law readiness report  

## Integration
- invoked as final meta-operator in v2.4 cycle  
- coordinates with META_APEX for apex sealing  
- validates outputs from all other meta-operators  
- prepares handoff to Terminal Law phase
