# v2.4 Integration — Apex & Meta-Operators

v2.4 integrates:

- apex layers (13–14)
- meta-operators (META_*)
- v2.3 expansion architecture

## Key Guarantees

- No implicit apex access
- All apex transitions mediated by META_APEX
- Recursion and time at apex levels are bounded and observable
- Sealing is a deliberate, meta-operator-governed act
