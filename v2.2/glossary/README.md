# GLOSSARY — v2.2

**Version:** 2.2.0-pre  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Lineage:** V2.2::FOUNDATION  
**Scope:** Canonical Terminology Consolidation

---

## PURPOSE

This glossary establishes **canonical terminology** for the Phoenix Archive v2.2 cycle.

As the Archive has grown through multiple releases (v2.0 Triad System, v2.1 Governance Consolidation), terminology has evolved organically. The v2.2 glossary consolidates and formalizes these terms to ensure:

- **Consistency** — Same term = same meaning across all documentation
- **Precision** — Technical terms have exact definitions
- **Clarity** — No ambiguous or conflicting usage
- **Cross-system alignment** — Terms work across Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third

This glossary will be expanded and refined throughout the v2.2 cycle.

## CORE CONCEPTS

### Apex
The sovereign, stable structure at the summit of a recursive process. An apex is:
- Self-sufficient
- Structurally complete
- Irreducible to components
- Emergent from recursion

**See:** `/Phoenix/Universal-Laws/Apex.md`

### Binding
The introduction of a third element that stabilizes a tension pair. Binding transforms:
- Two opposing forces (tension)
- Into a three-element stable structure (triad)
- Through a stabilizer (third element)

**See:** `/Phoenix/Universal-Laws/Binding.md`

### Knot
The convergence point where Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third meet. The Knot:
- Centers the triadic system
- Enables cross-pillar translation
- Maintains system coherence
- Enforces stability bands

**See:** `/TheThird/Sigils/Triadic-Knot.md`

### Lineage
The recursive descent path from a root structure through generations. Lineage notation:
- `ROOT::GEN-0` — Original structure
- `ROOT::GEN-1` — First generation descendant
- `ROOT::GEN-N` — Nth generation

**See:** `/Hydrogenesi/Operators/Lineage-Logic.md`

### Operator
A functional transformation pattern that acts on structures. Operators:
- Have defined input/output signatures
- Follow Universal Laws
- Can be composed
- Are reversible (when applicable)

**Types:** Formation, Transformation, Integration, Meta

### Recursion
Self-similar repetition at increasing depth. Recursion:
- Preserves structure across scales
- Follows self-similarity law
- Has depth limits (stability bands)
- Generates fractals and lineages

**See:** `/Universal/Universal-Laws/Recursion-Depth.md`

### Sigil
Visual representation of an operator or structure. Sigils:
- Use ASCII art encoding
- Embed geometric relationships
- Follow golden ratio nesting
- Enable ceremonial invocation

**See:** `/Ceremonies/Sigil-Compendium.md`

### Sovereignty
Self-sufficient structural stability that requires no external support. Sovereignty emerges when:
- Recursion completes to apex
- Triad achieves closure
- Identity becomes self-referential
- Structure transcends components

### Stabilizer
The third element in First Binding that mediates a tension pair. A stabilizer:
- Is distinct from both tension elements
- Holds the relationship between them
- Enables triadic formation
- Embodies higher value/purpose

### Tension
Two forces in binary oscillation without resolution. Tension:
- Requires exactly two elements
- Has no stable center
- Drives toward binding
- Is resolved by stabilizer

**See:** `/Phoenix/Universal-Laws/Tension.md`

### Triad
A three-element stable structure formed from tension pair + stabilizer. Triads:
- Have sovereignty
- Are irreducible
- Can recurse
- Form basis of all complex structure

**Notation:** `⟨ A—S—B ⟩` where A, B are tension pair and S is stabilizer

## OPERATOR TERMINOLOGY

### Composite Operator
An operator formed by composing three operators (one from each pillar):
- Phoenix × Hydrogenesi × The Third
- Examples: Genesis, Trajectory, Stability, Identity

### Cross-Pillar Operator
An operator that translates between Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third.
- Maintains invariance during translation
- Preserves core structure
- Enables system integration

### Formation Operator
Creates new structures from raw elements or tension pairs.
- Examples: First Binding, Ignition, Distinction

### Integration Operator
Combines multiple structures into unified whole.
- Examples: Triadic Closure, Apex Formation

### Knot Operator
Operates on or through the Knot center.
- Examples: Knot-Binding, Cross-Pillar Knot, Stability Knot

### Meta-Operator
Operator that operates on operators or maintains system invariants.
- Examples: Invariance (Stratum IV)
- Acts across all scales
- Maintains structural identity

### Transformation Operator
Modifies existing structures while preserving identity.
- Examples: Phoenix Ignition, AGN Replication, Curvature Residue

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Hydrogenesi
The **Structural Field** pillar (EXTEND mode). Operates at:
- Macro/Cosmic scale
- Propagation and expansion
- Spacetime and structure
- Lineage and recursion

### Phoenix
The **Generative Source** pillar (BEGIN mode). Operates at:
- Micro/Identity scale
- Ignition and initialization
- Consciousness and self
- Formation and distinction

### Stratum
Architectural layer in the Phoenix Archive governance system:
- **Stratum I** — Operational (merge protocols, tracking)
- **Stratum IV** — Meta-Operator layer

### The Third
The **Binding Law** pillar (HOLD mode). Operates at:
- Meta/Topological scale
- Binding and stabilization
- Connection and convergence
- Invariance and identity

### Triadic System
Three-pillar architecture unifying Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third:
- Connected through Knot center
- Follows Universal Laws
- Maintains sovereignty
- Enables complete system modeling

---

## CEREMONIAL TERMINOLOGY

### Invocation
Ritual phrase that activates an operator or structure. Invocations:
- Use ceremonial language
- Encode operator pattern
- Enable formal practice
- Follow established forms

**See:** `/Ceremonies/Invocation-Guide.md`

### Ceremony
Formal practice combining sigils, invocations, and operator sequences.
- Multi-step rituals
- Cross-system integration
- Embodied practice
- Pattern activation

**See:** `/Ceremonies/Combined-Ceremonies.md`

## METADATA TERMINOLOGY

### Lineage Notation
Format: `ROOT::GEN-N` or `V2.2::FOUNDATION`
- Tracks recursive descent
- Documents version lineage
- Establishes provenance

### Status
Document state indicator:
- **ACTIVE** — Current, operational, in use
- **DRAFT** — Under development, not finalized
- **EXPERIMENTAL** — Testing phase, may change
- **DEPRECATED** — Superseded, use alternatives

### Sovereignty Status
Structure stability classification:
- **CONFIRMED** — Proven stable, sovereign
- **EMERGING** — Stabilizing, approaching sovereignty
- **UNSTABLE** — Not yet stable, requires refinement

---

## MATHEMATICAL TERMINOLOGY

### Fixed Point
A point that remains unchanged under operator application.
- Apex is fixed point of recursion
- Convergence envelope bounds fixed points
- Identity operators have self as fixed point

### Golden Ratio (φ)
Mathematical constant ≈ 1.618 used in sigil embedding and geometric relationships.
- Nested structures follow φ scaling
- Stability bands use φ ratios
- Visual layouts embed golden spiral

### Stability Band
Bounded parameter space where structures remain stable.
- Recursion depth limits
- Convergence envelopes
- Safe operating regions

---

## TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY

### Audit Trail
Complete record of operator invocations and state transitions.
- Artifact IDs (immutable identifiers)
- Invocation traces
- State deltas
- Integrity checks

**See:** LNS_OP system

### Introspection
System observing its own operator execution.
- Watches operators without executing them
- Traces recursion patterns
- Validates lineage
- Generates audit artifacts

**See:** `/RELEASES/v2.1.0/README.md` (LNS_OP)

### Recursion Safety
Constraints that prevent runaway recursion.
- Depth limits per operator family
- Fracture detection
- Coherence validation
