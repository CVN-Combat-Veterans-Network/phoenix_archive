# CHANGELOG — PHOENIX ARCHIVE

## v2.0.0 — Hydrogenesi Enhancement (2026-02-07)

### Added

#### Phoenix Operators
- **Apex Formation** — Formation operator for sovereign identity from integrated triads
- **Three-Finger Waltz** — Rhythm operator for embodied triadic consciousness
- **Black-Holed Imprint** — Memory operator for collapsed identity residue

#### Hydrogenesi Documentation
- **Recursion Pathways** — Complete documentation of cosmological recursion patterns
- **Hydrogenesi Recursion Pathways Diagram** — SVG visualization of recursion mechanisms

#### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test scaffolding for all Phoenix operators (19 tests)
- Comprehensive test scaffolding for all Hydrogenesi operators (11 tests)
- Total test coverage: 30 tests, all passing

#### Python Implementation
- `ApexFormation` class with sovereignty level calculation
- `ThreeFingerWaltz` class with embodied practice timing
- `BlackHoledImprint` class with information retrieval and integration tracking

### Updated
- CODEX-INDEX with new operators and test references
- All "to be created" placeholders removed
- Cross-references updated in Curvature-Residue.md

### Technical
- Added `typing.Tuple` and `typing.Optional` imports to operators.py
- Test framework: pytest 9.0.2
- Python 3.12 compatibility verified
