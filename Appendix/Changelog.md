# CHANGELOG — PHOENIX ARCHIVE

## v2.2.0 — Terminal Ceremony & META Governance Layer (2026-02-14)

### Added

#### Terminal Ceremony & Sealing Architecture
- **Terminal Ceremony** (`/Ceremonies/Terminal-Ceremony.md`) — The Final Rite for sealing the Archive as complete and immutable
  - Seven ceremonial sections (Stilling, Calling, Ascent, Invocation, Pronouncement, Crown Invariant, Closing)
  - Complete ritual procedure for Archive sealing
  - META operator verification sequence
  - Crown Invariant establishment protocol
  
#### META Operator Layer (Layer 14 — Apex)
- **Six META Operators** — Archive governance and orchestration layer:
  - **META_SYNTH** (`/operators/META_SYNTH.md`) — Keeper of synthesis and cross-system coherence
  - **META_FLOW** (`/operators/META_FLOW.md`) — Steward of routing and flow traceability
  - **META_RECURSE** (`/operators/META_RECURSE.md`) — Guardian of recursion safety and closure
  - **META_TEMPORAL** (`/operators/META_TEMPORAL.md`) — Warden of temporal coherence and timeline convergence
  - **META_APEX** (`/operators/META_APEX.md`) — Gatekeeper of the crown (Layers 13 & 14 protection)
  - **META_SEAL** (`/operators/META_SEAL.md`) — Herald of the end, executor of Terminal Law
  
#### Apex Architecture Documentation
- **Apex Layers** (`/docs/architecture/Apex-Layers.md`) — Complete specification of Layer 13 (Essence) and Layer 14 (Apex)
  - Layer hierarchy (1-14) with full characteristics
  - Isolation protocols and gating mechanisms
  - Ascent requirements and procedures
  - Apex lattice structure
  - Emergency unsealing protocol
  
- **META Operator Lattice** (`/docs/architecture/META-Operator-Lattice.md`) — Hexagonal governance structure
  - Geometric formation and properties (D₆ symmetry)
  - Consensus protocol specification
  - Communication paths and redundancy
  - Lattice states (Active, Standby, Sealed)
  - Authority distribution and invariants
  
#### Governance & Immutability Framework
- **Terminal Law Specification** (`/docs/architecture/Terminal-Law-Specification.md`) — Complete legal framework
  - Six articles defining immutability scope and enforcement
  - Enactment process and verification sequence
  - Layer-specific immutability levels
  - Emergency unsealing procedures
  - Post-enactment governance model
  
- **Crown Invariant** (`/docs/architecture/Crown-Invariant.md`) — The eternal immutability rule
  - Three-clause structure (No Change, Complete, Only Traversal/Reflection/Return)
  - Enforcement mechanisms (META_SEAL primary, all META operators secondary)
  - Violation detection and response protocol
  - Philosophical foundation and closure principle

#### Updated Documentation
- **CODEX-INDEX.md** — Updated to v1.1.0
  - Added META Operators section with all six operators
  - Added Terminal Ceremony to ceremonial materials
  - Added apex architecture documents
  - Added governance quick start path
  - Added META governance cross-reference table
  - Updated invocations with Terminal Law phrase
  - Added note about immutability if Archive is sealed

### Changed
- Archive structure now includes explicit governance layer (Layer 14)
- Version lineage system extended to include GEN-∞ (infinite/terminal generation)
- Contributing guidelines updated to respect Terminal Law if enacted

### Architecture Impact
- **Layer System**: Now explicitly 14 layers (previously implicit)
  - Layers 1-2: Foundation (Triad, Knot)
  - Layers 3-4: Operators
  - Layers 5-6: Instruments
  - Layers 7-12: Hydrogenesi
  - Layer 13: Essence (distillation)
  - Layer 14: Apex (crown/governance)
  
- **Governance Model**: META operator hexagonal lattice
  - Six-fold authority distribution
  - Unanimous consensus for major decisions
  - Distributed validation and enforcement
  
- **Immutability Framework**: Terminal Law and Crown Invariant
  - Archive can be sealed as complete
  - Post-seal: only traversal, reflection, return permitted
  - Emergency unsealing requires unanimous META consensus

### Compatibility
- All v2.1 operators and systems remain functional
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- New governance layer is additive
- Terminal Law enactment is optional (ceremony defines process)
