## Cross-Family Integration Requirements

### Integration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Sequential Integration
```
PHX_OP → HGN_OP → LNS_OP
```
Each operator consumes output of previous operator.

**Requirements:**
- Compatible output/input formats
- State preservation across operators
- Lineage tracking through chain

---

#### Pattern 2: Parallel Integration
```
        ┌─ HGN_OP_1 ─┐
PHX_OP ─┤            ├─ MERGE → LNS_OP
        └─ HGN_OP_2 ─┘
```
Multiple operators execute in parallel, results merged.

**Requirements:**
- Parallel execution support
- Merge conflict resolution
- Coherence validation across branches

---

#### Pattern 3: Triadic Integration
```
    PHX_OP
      │
   THIRD_OP (mediator)
      │
   HGN_OP
```
Third operator mediates between two families.

**Requirements:**
- Mediator operator from The Third family
- Triadic coherence validation
- Law compliance at mediation point

---

### Integration Hooks Enhancement

**Current Integration:**
- Phoenix → LNS_OP integration
- Hydrogenesis → LNS_OP integration
- The Third → LNS_OP integration

**v2.2 Enhancement:**
- Phoenix ⟷ Hydrogenesis direct integration
- Phoenix ⟷ The Third direct integration
- Hydrogenesis ⟷ The Third direct integration

**v2.3 Enhancement:**
- Triadic integration patterns
- Cross-family operator chaining
- Universal integration layer
