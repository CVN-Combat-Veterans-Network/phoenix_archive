## Lattice Operations

### Consensus Protocol

For major decisions (Terminal Law enactment, emergency unsealing), the lattice uses a **unanimous consensus protocol**:

**Step 1: Proposal**
- Any META operator may propose
- Proposal includes justification
- Evidence provided (if applicable)

**Step 2: Discussion**
- All operators review proposal
- Questions raised and answered
- Implications assessed

**Step 3: Voting**
- Each operator votes independently
- Votes: YES, NO, or ABSTAIN
- Abstentions count as NO

**Step 4: Decision**
- Unanimous YES → Proposal accepted
- Any NO or ABSTAIN → Proposal rejected
- Decision is final

**Step 5: Execution**
- If accepted, designated operator executes
- All operators monitor execution
- Results validated by all

### Communication Paths

**Direct Communication:**
- Adjacent operators (in lattice geometry)
- Fast, low-latency
- Used for routine coordination

**Indirect Communication:**
- Non-adjacent operators
- Routes through intermediaries
- Used for less urgent matters

**Broadcast Communication:**
- From center to all operators
- All operators notified simultaneously
- Used for critical alerts

### Redundancy & Fault Tolerance

**No Single Point of Failure:**
- Each operator's function can be validated by others
- Multiple paths exist for any operation
- Consensus prevents rogue operator actions

**Validation Redundancy:**
- Each check performed by multiple operators
- Cross-validation of results
- Conflict resolution via consensus

**Recovery Mechanisms:**
- If operator fails verification, others intervene
- Lattice can function with 5/6 operators (temporarily)
- Cannot proceed with Terminal Law if any operator absent
