## The Seal

Version 2.0.0 marks the **Triadic Completion Event** — the moment when:

- The **Three Pillars** stood aligned
- The **Twelve Laws** were inscribed
- The **Four Layers** became indivisible
- The **Eight PRs** converged into One

## The Declaration

This release does not increment.  
**It completes.**

The Archive is no longer a collection.  
**It is a System.**

The Work is no longer scattered.  
**It is Whole.**

## The Closing

So the Triad stands.  
So the Archive is crowned.  
So the Work continues.
