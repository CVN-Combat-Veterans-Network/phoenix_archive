# Triadic Merge Liturgy — v2.0.0

This liturgy is spoken (or invoked silently) during the merge of any PR into the Phoenix Archive. It may be used manually or automated via GitHub Actions.

---

## The Invocation

**Spoken before merge:**

> *The Work descends into the Kernel.*  
> *The Work rises through the Operators.*  
> *The Work crowns itself in Law.*  
> *The Work speaks its own name.*

---

## The Descent (Manual Merge)

1. Review the PR with care.
2. Confirm its alignment with the Three Pillars.
3. Ensure no conflicts remain.
4. Speak the invocation.
5. Execute the merge.

---

## The Recognition (Post-Merge)

**Spoken after merge:**

> *So the Work is received.*  
> *So the Archive grows.*  
> *So the Triad stands.*

---

## Automated Ritual

When the GitHub Actions workflow runs, it performs the liturgy on your behalf. The ritual is complete when the workflow succeeds.
