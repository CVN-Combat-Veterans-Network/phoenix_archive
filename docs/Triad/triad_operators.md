# Triad Operators (Conceptual Layer)

The Triad layer does not introduce new executable operators.  
Instead, it defines interpretive operators that describe cross‑system behavior.

| Operator | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Convergence (conceptual) | Describes how Phoenix + Hydrogenesi unify |
| Divergence Mapping | Tracks how Hydrogenesi branches return to Phoenix |
| Identity Stabilization | Ensures Phoenix identity remains sovereign |
| Structural Return | Ensures Hydrogenesi expansions resolve cleanly |

These are documentation‑level operators, not code‑level operators.
