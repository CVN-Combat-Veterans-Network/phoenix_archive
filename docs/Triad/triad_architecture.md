# Triad Architecture

The Triad architecture describes the flow between Phoenix and Hydrogenesi.

It is a two-pillar system with a shared interpretive layer.

## Principles
- Phoenix governs identity and recursion
- Hydrogenesi governs expansion and divergence
- The Triad governs the relationship between them
