# Triad Overview

The Triad is the interpretive layer that describes how Phoenix and Hydrogenesi interact, bind, and transform across systems.

It is not a subsystem.  
It is a meta‑framework.

## Purpose
- Provide cross‑system coherence
- Define shared laws
- Document recursion flows between systems
- Maintain structural integrity across domains
