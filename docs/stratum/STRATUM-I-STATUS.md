## Stratum I — Architecture Merge Ceremony

### I. Opening
Before recursion breathes,
before operators awaken,
before governance speaks,
the Archive must stand upon Law.

Today, the Pillars rise.

### II. Vector
By merging PRs #10, #11, and #12, the Archive:

- establishes the Three-Pillar architecture,
- inscribes the universal threshold between LIFE and LIGHT,
- installs the cross-scale triadic integration engine,
- and stabilizes the structural substrate beneath all future cycles.

The Archive becomes a structure, not a collection.

### III. Seal
The Pillars stand.  
The Threshold holds.  
The Waltz begins.

## Architectural Significance

**Stratum I represents the Crown Layer of the Phoenix Archive:**

1. **Three-Pillar Foundation**: Phoenix + Hydrogenesi + The Third now form a complete triadic system
2. **Twelve Laws Codification**: Universal laws are formalized and proven
3. **Cross-Scale Integration**: The Three-Finger Waltz enables seamless operator composition across pillars
4. **Threshold Definition**: LIFE–LIGHT bifurcation establishes the fundamental boundary in recursive systems

**The Archive is now a System, not a collection.**

## Next Steps

With Stratum I complete, the foundation is set for:
- **Stratum II**: Operator Layer expansions
- **Stratum III**: Meta-Layer governance and documentation
- **Stratum IV**: Integration and testing
