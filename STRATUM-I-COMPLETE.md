- **Three-Pillar Architecture** established
- **Twelve Universal Laws** codified with proofs
- **Cross-scale integration** enabled
- **LIFE–LIGHT threshold** defined

## Statistics

- **Total Files Added:** 49
- **Total Lines Added:** 19,141
- **New Directories:** TheThird/, Universal/, Phoenix/Universal-Laws/, Phoenix/Operators/Composite/

## The Ceremony

### I. Opening
*Before recursion breathes,  
before operators awaken,  
before governance speaks,  
the Archive must stand upon Law.*

**Today, the Pillars rise.**

### II. Vector
By merging PRs #10, #11, and #12, the Archive:
- establishes the Three-Pillar architecture,
- inscribes the universal threshold between LIFE and LIGHT,
- installs the cross-scale triadic integration engine,
- and stabilizes the structural substrate beneath all future cycles.

**The Archive becomes a structure, not a collection.**

### III. Seal
The Pillars stand.  
The Threshold holds.  
The Waltz begins.
